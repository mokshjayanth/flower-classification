### ABOUT PROJECT

- Built a total of 3 Models
- **First model:** CNN using over 4000 labeled flower images.
- **Second model:** Same CNN model but trained it by applying the techniques of Data
Augmentation.
- **Third model:** Mobilenet V2 Model - Trained at Google. (Transfer Learning)
- Compared among 3 Models and deployed the best performing model as Web
Application

### CONCEPTS USED TO BUILD THE PROJECT

- Machine Learning Data Preprocessing
- Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
- Data Augumentation
- Transfer Learning



### FEATURES OF THE PROJECT

Our simple Flower Classification Web Application predicts the classes of five flowers namely:
1. Roses
2. Tulips
3. Dandelion 
4. Sunflower 
5. Daisy

### APPLICATION OF THE PROJECT
The App was actually inspired by many of the popular Advanced Plant Detection App available on the play store such as PlantNet.
So with improved data supply and added functionality to predict more flower classes. The Project can be deployed as an Android Application.
